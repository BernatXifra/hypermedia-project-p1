1. User profile:
    - The target user of this website is a Talent Acquisition Specialist, someone who is looking for young, talented students who are searching for their first job involving web design skills. The user is expected to find an eye-catching website that demonstrates the creator's potential.


2. Information architecture: 
    - The distribution of the page can be split it in three sections: personal information, as my flaws and how to contact me; career background, technical information about what have I done professionaly; additional information that might make the difference with other candidates, such as the languages I speak or if I own a car in order to do long distance trips.

    In the first section there are my profile photo, my attitudes and how to contact me. This section is to get to know me personally like how I look, which are my attitudes and how to contact me or get some extra information.

    The second section consist in sharing my trajectory. What have I studied and where, such as which is my experience in the professional field.

    The last section is to add some extra information that might be relevant and can make the difference with other candidates. In there I decided to include the languages I studied and my disponibility. Also that I own a car and I have a driver's license.


3. Visual design: 
    - I chose a simple design to focus on clarity and the most important information. My aim was to create a clean and professional layout that communicates information efficiently while maintaining a pleasing appearance.
    
    My design follows a minimalist visual style in terms of color, using a neutral palette to ensure readability and a balanced look.
    
    I didnâ€™t spend too much time choosing the typography; I looked for a simple, readable, and basic font to maintain the clean and professional look I was aiming for.
    
    All the sections are well aligned and clearly separated, making them easy to identify.
